  \hline
  \textbf{Opportunities -- O}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.8em]
    \item Annoyance with the waiting times and high prices of cab companies
    \item Exploitation of large, new markets such as India where taxis are expensive and inconvenient
    \item Tapping into small town markets where there are no cab companies
    \item Cheaper electric cars which increase the profit margin of drivers by reducing car upkeep costs
    \item Growing number of drivers reduces the wait times, increasing public profile 
    \item Offer of additional services such as school runs, pet-vet transport and the transport of patients to hospitals.
  \end{itemize}
  &
  \textbf{Threats -- T}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.8em]
    \item Drivers with low profit margins may leave and create bad publicity, discouraging new drivers from joining
    \item Legal regulations in certain countries will ban Uber from operating (e.g.\ Germany)
    \item Large number of drivers results in increasing number of frauds and scandals occurring
    \item Growing competition (and ease of creating such competition) dilutes the Uber monopoly in certain markets
    \item Google's not-yet-developed self-driving cars would eliminate the need for a company such as Uber
